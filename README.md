# Setup

```
mkdir -p Workspace/TOFPET
cd Workspace/TOFPET
git clone https://github.com/CMSROMA/Timing-TOFPET.git
cd Timing-TOFPET
cmake .
make
```
# Connect TOFPET

From a terminal
```
cd Workspace/TOFPET/Timing-TOFPET
./connect_TOFPET.sh
```

It will display
```
cmsdaq@pccmsdaq01:~/Workspace/TOFPET/Timing-TOFPET$ ./connect_TOFPET.sh 
Size of frame is 16384
Got FPGA reply
FrameServer::startWorker called...
FrameServer::startWorker exiting...

```

Always keep this process active during a run in this terminal.

# Run TOFPET

Open a new terminal. 

Edit configuration file:
```
config_main.txt
```

Start data taking
```
python run_TOFPET.py -c config_main.txt
```

## Notes
- The calibration (RUN_CALIB 1 in config file) should be re-run each time there is a new hardware configuration (e.g. different SiPMs, different hardware settings). It takes about 30-40 minutes to finish. 
- Once the calibration step is done, the following runs can be taken using the existing calibration files (RUN_CALIB 0 in config file) 
- Two output root files are produced: 
  - xxx_singles.root: the tree contains one event for each channel passing the trigger selection  
  - xxx_coincidences.root: the tree contains one event for each pair of channels passing the trigger selection if they are in time coincidence (default t2-t1<20 ns)  
- Channel numbering in root file: Absolute channel ID (root file) = 64 x NCHIP + NCH  where NCHIP, NCH are reported in the config file.
